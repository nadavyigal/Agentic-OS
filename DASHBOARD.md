# Portfolio Dashboard

Last updated: 2026-07-09 IDT

Local folder mode. Refreshed by ./agentic-os from PROJECT-PATHS.md, local git, task memory/todo/session files, and existing dashboard status. No external dashboards queried.

## Executive Summary

RunSmart iOS — PHASE 2 — Activation diagnostics + record-run polish follow-ups (WP-38 closed): S13 only if HealthKit accuracy gate clears; otherwise next work packet from Agentic OS · Resumely iOS — Post-launch — activation measurement is hardened; WP-37 S1/S4 shipped to `main`; S2/S3/S5 are web-side (separate repo), already shipped per that repo's progress log: Founder submits 1.4.1 (11); then re-read the PostHog picker→file-selected funnel 7-14d post-1.4 for a real cohort · RunSmart Web — Garmin track is maintenance-only per the 2026-07-02 priority-reset decision (Resumely primary). No relaunch work in progress; only breakage fixes · ResumeBuilder AI (Web) — WP-29 Resumely web funnel P0 fixes — S1-S4 completed; S5 anonymous-session carryover is next

Best next action: Resumely iOS: Founder submits 1.4.1 (11); then re-read the PostHog picker→file-selected funnel 7-14d post-1.4 for a real cohort

## Project Health

| Project | State | Next Action | Dirty | Freshness | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RunSmart iOS | PHASE 2 — Activation diagnostics + record-run polish follow-ups (WP-38 closed) | S13 only if HealthKit accuracy gate clears; otherwise next work packet from Agentic OS | No | Fresh | High |
| Resumely iOS | Post-launch — activation measurement is hardened; WP-37 S1/S4 shipped to `main`; S2/S3/S5 are web-side (separate repo), already shipped per that repo's progress log | Founder submits 1.4.1 (11); then re-read the PostHog picker→file-selected funnel 7-14d post-1.4 for a real cohort | No | Fresh | High |
| RunSmart Web | Garmin track is maintenance-only per the 2026-07-02 priority-reset decision (Resumely primary). No relaunch work in progress; only breakage fixes | **Still paused.** Restoring actual sync for the 9 reauth_required users needs either a working production/commercial credential set (WP-26 Steps 3-4) or pointing real users at the Evaluation-tier Internal Test app (the same Terms violation that got the old app deactivated) — there is no maintenance-mode-compatible fix available. This is a fact worth surfacing at the day-30 revisit (~2026-08-01), not a reason to resume now. See Agentic OS WP-26/27/28 for the paused relaunch scope | Yes | Fresh | High |
| ResumeBuilder AI (Web) | WP-29 Resumely web funnel P0 fixes — S1-S4 completed; S5 anonymous-session carryover is next | WP-29 S5 — design and implement anonymous session carryover after signup so the first dashboard is not empty | Yes | Fresh | High |
| Agentic OS | Advanced OS patterns lean pilot | Use the Resumely submission loop in two COO reviews; optionally add GLOBAL-OUTPUT-CONTRACT.md (deferred from the prompt study); add no further loop cards unless current and non-duplicative | Yes | Fresh | High |

## Work Packet Hygiene

- None. Active/open packet states match the current project status.

## Decision Board

| Decision | Project | Recommendation | Urgency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RunSmart iOS: build 8 rejection response scope | RunSmart iOS | Minimal fix targeting only the rejection reason. Ship as build 9. Save v2 feature scope for after approval. | Conditional — only if build 8 is rejected |
| RunSmart iOS: when to flip VOICE_COACH_ENABLED in Vercel | RunSmart iOS | Flip after approval + physical-device voice QA passes. Do not flip before the app is live. | Post-approval |
| Resumely iOS: App Store upload path | Resumely iOS | Manual Xcode Organizer path. EXD-006 resolved: no Fastlane, no .p8 key found. Xcode Organizer is the path. | High — next action after device smoke |
| ResumeBuilder Web rollout timing | ResumeBuilder AI Web | Defer unless Resumely smoke finds backend blockers. | Low |

## Agent Delegation

- **Release Manager**: Handle an App Store review outcome without reopening completed submission work. Evidence: PROJECT-STATUS.md, dashboard/status.json, ResumeBuilder iOS tasks/session-log.md
- **CEO OS**: Resolve the next portfolio decision and keep focus tight. Evidence: executive-os/EXECUTIVE-DASHBOARD.md, dashboard/status.json decisionBoard
- **Director / Orchestrator**: Turn the current Action Board into one reviewable work packet. Evidence: dashboard/status.json priorityBoard and projectHealth
- **QA**: Verify dashboard or product readiness with evidence. Evidence: GLOBAL-QA-RULES.md, dashboard runCenter checksRun

## Evidence Gaps

- RunSmart Web: validated 2026-07-03, latest commit is newer.
- ResumeBuilder AI (Web): validated 2026-07-03, latest commit is newer.
- Agentic OS: validated 2026-06-12, latest commit is newer.

## Drift Warnings

- None. Curated narrative matches the parsed source for all High-confidence projects.

## Validation

- parser unit tests
- dashboard/status.json parsed
- embedded dashboard JSON parsed
- project-status.html fallback sync checked
- source confidence and freshness validated
- drift warnings checked
- git diff --check
